Then, as always it is, he told me he was working with IoT-Sensors to monitor the air quality, and I  was working in how to use the data of industrial sensors to train machine learning models. Then, the question: what about if you collect the data in El Salvador and the data is received in a virtual private cloud in Belgium via MQTT.</p> <p>A couple of years later, Carlos came back from his doctoral studies in Japan. And he was working on the monitoring of volcanic activity measuring volcanic gases. And we had the first call about how to apply the IoT expertise of Otoniel and the data science that I  was practicing together with the experience of Carlos in the volcanic activity monitoring.</p> <p>And so started the MR-HUB! </p> <p>Since then, we have been doing research in different environmental topics, trying new IoT architectures, IoT stations, new sensors, data analysis, data platforms, predictive models ...</p>"},{"location":"about/#research-team","title":"Research Team","text":""},{"location":"about/#fernando-arevalo","title":"Fernando Ar\u00e9valo","text":"<p>I am a researcher, data scientist, and electrical engineer with professional experience in various industries.

In El Salvador, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) has identified a lack of adequate air quality monitoring. Currently, the Ministry of Environment (MARN) operates only three monitoring stations nationwide, limiting accurate assessments of pollution levels.</p> <p>To address this issue, we developed a low-cost, mobile IoT-based system to monitor and map air quality. The system measures key pollutants, including particulate matter and formaldehyde, along with temperature and humidity. It also visualizes air quality using the Central American Air Quality Index (CAQI). A web-based platform enables real-time data storage, visualization, and geospatial mapping.</p> <p>A prototype was tested over a one-month period on 15 routes across San Salvador, revealing that air quality generally ranged from good to moderate. This innovative approach provides an affordable solution for public and private organizations to improve air quality monitoring and urban planning.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"research/mangroves/","title":"Monitoring of Mangroves","text":""},{"location":"research/thermic/","title":"Monitoring of thermic heat","text":"<p>With advancements in open and low-cost technologies, estimating land surface temperature (LST) using satellite remote sensing has become a viable alternative to traditional methods. LST is a key factor in understanding energy and water exchanges between land and atmosphere, influencing evaporation, crop production, and climate conditions.</p> <p>In El Salvador, climate monitoring is limited, with only 27 weather stations covering the entire country. This study proposes a low-cost methodology for LST estimation using Landsat 8 satellite imagery and QGIS software. By leveraging thermal infrared data (8\u201314 \u03bcm), this approach enables accurate temperature mapping in areas lacking ground-based monitoring.</p> <p>The method was tested in the rural cities of Berlin, Alegr\u00eda, and Santiago de Mar\u00eda, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying potential agricultural stressors like heatwaves and water scarcity.

The Ministry of Environment currently uses LI-830 sensors, which, despite their reliability, lack wireless connectivity, real-time data access, and storage capabilities. These limitations make it difficult to efficiently track CO\u2082 emissions from volcanic soils.</p> <p>To modernize this process, we developed an IoT-based system that upgrades existing LI-830 sensors by integrating an ESP32 microcontroller and a SIM800L transceiver. This innovation enables real-time CO\u2082 data collection and wireless transmission. A cloud-based web platform, built using Python and Google Cloud tools, provides remote access to measurements, allowing volcanologists to monitor and analyze CO\u2082 levels effectively.</p> <p>A pilot test at Cerro Pacho demonstrated the system\u2019s effectiveness in improving CO\u2082 surveillance. By upgrading existing equipment rather than replacing it, this solution offers a cost-efficient way to enhance volcanic monitoring in El Salvador and similar high-risk regions worldwide.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"research/water_quality/","title":"Monitoring of water quality","text":"<p>Water quality is essential for environmental health and economic activities like fish farming. However, monitoring water parameters can be challenging in countries with limited resources and infrastructure, such as El Salvador.

The system integrates an Atmega328 microcontroller with pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), and temperature sensors, along with a Wi-Fi transceiver for remote data transmission. A web application allows users to access real-time measurements and monitor water conditions from anywhere.</p> <p>A pilot test was conducted in a fish farm in El Salvador, demonstrating that the system effectively tracks water parameters. The results highlight its potential as an affordable and efficient solution for aquaculture and other water-dependent industries.
