# About MR-HUB

Everything happened during the preparation of an exam for signal processing as part of my doctoral studies, I had a call with Otoniel 
and we were catching up. Then, as always it is, he told me he was working with IoT-Sensors to monitor the air quality, and I 
was working in how to use the data of industrial sensors to train machine learning models. Then, the question: what about if you
collect the data in El Salvador and the data is received in a virtual private cloud in Belgium via MQTT.

A couple of years later, Carlos came back from his doctoral studies in Japan. And he was working on the monitoring of volcanic activity
measuring volcanic gases. And we had the first call about how to apply the IoT expertise of Otoniel and the data science that I 
was practicing together with the experience of Carlos in the volcanic activity monitoring.

And so started the MR-HUB! 

Since then, we have been doing research in different environmental topics, trying new IoT architectures, IoT stations, new sensors, data analysis, data platforms, predictive models ...
