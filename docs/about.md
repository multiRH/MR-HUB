# About Multi-Research-Hub

Everything happened while preparing for an exam for signal processing as part of my doctoral studies in 2019. I had a call with Otoniel 
and we were catching up. Then, as always, he told me he was working with IoT sensors to monitor air quality, and I was working on using industrial sensors' data to train machine learning models. Then, the question: what about if you collect the data in El Salvador and the data is received in a virtual private cloud in Belgium via MQTT. 

Carlos returned from his doctoral studies in Japan and started working on monitoring volcanic activity and measuring volcanic gases. In 2022, we had our first meeting about how to apply Otoniel's IoT expertise and my data science practice, together with Carlos's experience in volcanic activity monitoring.

And so started the MR-HUB! 

Since then, we have been researching different environmental topics, trying new IoT architectures, IoT stations, new sensors, data analysis, data platforms, predictive models, ...
