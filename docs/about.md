# About Multi-Research-Hub

It all began around 2021, after Carlos returned from his doctoral studies. He was actively researching volcanic gas monitoring in El Salvador. 
Otoniel was working with IoT stations to monitor air quality in different cities in El Salvador.
And I was working with industrial sensor data to train machine learning models as part of my doctoral studies in Germany. 
Then we met for the first time and thought about how we could combine Otoniel's IoT know-how, Carlos' experience with volcanic activity monitoring,
and my expertise in data science and machine learning.

And so started the MR-HUB! 

Since then, we have been researching different environmental topics, trying new IoT architectures, IoT stations, new sensors, data analysis, data platforms, predictive models, ...
