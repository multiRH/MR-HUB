# Monitoring of air quality

Air pollution is a major environmental and public health concern, especially in urban areas. In El Salvador, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) has identified a lack of adequate air quality monitoring. Currently, the Ministry of Environment (MARN) operates only three monitoring stations nationwide, limiting accurate assessments of pollution levels.

To address this issue, we developed a low-cost, mobile IoT-based system to monitor and map air quality. The system measures key pollutants, including particulate matter and formaldehyde, along with temperature and humidity. It also visualizes air quality using the Central American Air Quality Index (CAQI). A web-based platform enables real-time data storage, visualization, and geospatial mapping.

A prototype was tested over a one-month period on 15 routes across San Salvador, revealing that air quality generally ranged from good to moderate. This innovative approach provides an affordable solution for public and private organizations to improve air quality monitoring and urban planning.
