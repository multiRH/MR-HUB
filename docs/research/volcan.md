# Monitoring of volcanic emissions

El Salvador's volcanic activity requires continuous CO₂ monitoring to assess eruption risks. The Ministry of Environment currently uses LI-830 sensors, which, despite their reliability, lack wireless connectivity, real-time data access, and storage capabilities. These limitations make it difficult to efficiently track CO₂ emissions from volcanic soils.

To modernize this process, we developed an IoT-based system that upgrades existing LI-830 sensors by integrating an ESP32 microcontroller and a SIM800L transceiver. This innovation enables real-time CO₂ data collection and wireless transmission. A cloud-based web platform, built using Python and Google Cloud tools, provides remote access to measurements, allowing volcanologists to monitor and analyze CO₂ levels effectively.

A pilot test at Cerro Pacho demonstrated the system’s effectiveness in improving CO₂ surveillance. By upgrading existing equipment rather than replacing it, this solution offers a cost-efficient way to enhance volcanic monitoring in El Salvador and similar high-risk regions worldwide.
